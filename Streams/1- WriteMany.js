Right, now I see what you're onto Joseph. I can't do the following because it just re-writes the i-th number in the file during each iteration, that's stupid.

Well then we'll have to .... 

-> read the file each time before we write to it (or we can maintain an in-memory string)
-> add the i-th number to the previously read data (string)
-> re-write that whole data (string) again onto the file

and do this a million times, well that's not pretty.

            -------------------

Well, I ran this dumb implementation, not for a million times but I did it for one-tenth of it i.e. 1e5 times and yes it was painful af. Below are the benchmarking results:

Well the following code is Joseph's solution to this challenge and it works surprisingly well, compared to mine. I'll be frank I don't understand why that's the case. This code successfully wrote numbers from 1 to 1e6 within 20.639s.

CPU Usage: ~100% i.e. one-core
