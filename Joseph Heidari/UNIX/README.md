# UNIX

## Task

1. Edit the .bashrc & .profile files in the root by adding an echo statement at the top that says something like `running the .profile file` or `running the .bashrc file`. 
2. Now try run both non-login and login shells to see the output.

## Observations

1. Non-Login shells only run `.bashrc` file while Login shells run both `.bashrc` and `.profile` files.
